description: Society has forgiven Jo Corbin for killing a man, but can he forgive
  himself? Will the Postmistress lose all in a bid to help a friend escape justice?
  Will the new teaching assistant's unorthodox ways tame the unruly pioneer children?
  These are just three of the nine wonderful short stories from Bret Harte, set in
  wild and wooly 19th century California.
